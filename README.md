# Basic Calculator Project Overview

# Project Description

The Basic Calculator project is a simple Java-based command-line application that performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Features

- User Input: The application prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operation.
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: The application performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's input.
- Error Handling: The application handles errors such as division by zero and invalid operation choices.
- Result Display: The application displays the result of the operation.

# Technical Details

- Programming Language: Java
- Input/Output: Command-line interface
- Error Handling: Try-catch blocks and conditional statements

# Project Structure

- Main Class: BasicCalculator.java
- Methods: main(), Scanner methods for user input
- Variables: num1, num2, choice, result, validOperation

# How it Works

1. The application prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. The user enters the numbers, and the application reads the input using Scanner methods.
3. The application prompts the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
4. The user enters their choice, and the application reads the input using Scanner methods.
5. The application performs the selected operation based on the user's input.
6. The application displays the result of the operation.
7. If the user enters an invalid operation choice or attempts to divide by zero, the application displays an error message.

# Conclusion

The Basic Calculator project is a simple yet effective demonstration of basic arithmetic operations in Java. It showcases the use of Scanner methods for user input, conditional statements for error handling, and basic arithmetic operations.
